The model loosely designed based off SUTDâ€™s library, we hope we will accurately depict how effective a school is in handling the students study requirements. A full model, scaled from our initial set, will be able to project adequate data on the utilization of study rooms via statistics and visual data. Be it in periods of exceedingly high use like weeks prior to exams and project submissions or factoring in the effects of an increasing cohort size, we hope the model will allow school administrators to make clear decisions which will have cascading improvements of efficiency, be it in the targeted increase in settings or policy adjustments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Motivation:</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">To ease administrator considerations when planning effective study facilities in educational institutions by providing a scalable model that automatically generates evaluative data and insights.</p></body></html>
